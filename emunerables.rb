  # Write ruby code to return the longest word in the list supplied ( words )

# create a method called isMale that filters for a gender of 'M' and returns those elements

# create a method called isFemale that filters for a gender of 'F' and returns those elements

# create a method called filterGender that takes in the students array and a callback, which 
# will be one of the previous isMale or isFemale methods.  It will return all elements that 
# meet that condition

# create a variable called allMales that stores the result of calling filterGender and the isMale callback

# create a variable called allFemales that stores the result of calling filterGender and the isFemale callback

# Create a method called countDuplicates that will take in an array of objects. Each object has a color key that contains an array of colors. 

# Colors names are repeated in the array. Return a new object that contains key names of each color and how many times they have been they have been referenced.

# Input: [ {colors: ['blue','purple','red']}, {colors: ['black','orange','blue']}, {colors: ['green','red', 'blue']} ]
# Output: { blue: 3, purple: 1, red: 2, black: 1, orange: 1, green: 1 }
